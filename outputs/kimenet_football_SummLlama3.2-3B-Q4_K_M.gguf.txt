Football, also known as soccer in some parts of the world, is a globally popular sport with origins dating back thousands of years, including ancient China's "Cuju" and the Greek and Roman games "Episkyros" and "Harpastum". Modern football began to take shape in England in the mid-19th century with the founding of the Football Association (FA) in 1863, leading to the codification of rules that became the foundation of the modern game. The sport spread globally through the British Empire, with international matches starting in 1872 and the FIFA World Cup first held in 1930 in Uruguay, becoming the most prestigious event in world football. The game has evolved over time with changes in tactics, technologies like VAR and goal-line technology, and massive commercial interests driving its global appeal, making it a multi-billion-dollar industry with millions of fans worldwide.
