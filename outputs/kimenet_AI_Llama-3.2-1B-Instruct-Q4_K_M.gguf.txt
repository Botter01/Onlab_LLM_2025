The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. AI-driven diagnostic tools and algorithms enhance patient outcomes, fraud detection, and trading strategies in finance. In transportation, self-driving cars promise to reduce accidents and increase efficiency. However, AI raises ethical concerns, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job displacement, which need to be addressed through regulations and guidelines.
