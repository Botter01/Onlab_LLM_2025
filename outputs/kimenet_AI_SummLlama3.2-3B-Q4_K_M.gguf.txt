The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation, with AI-driven diagnostic tools improving patient outcomes, AI-powered algorithms enhancing fraud detection and customer service, and self-driving cars promising reduced traffic accidents. However, AI also raises ethical concerns, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job displacement, which experts argue require strict regulations and guidelines to ensure beneficial and fair development.
