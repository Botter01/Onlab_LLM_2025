Football, also known as soccer, is a popular sport globally with ancient origins. The modern game began in England in the mid-19th century with the establishment of the Football Association (FA) in 1863. The British Empire facilitated its spread across the world, with the first international match played between Scotland and England in 1872. The FIFA World Cup was held in 1930 in Uruguay, becoming the most prestigious event in world football. Over time, the game has evolved with changes in tactics and technologies, including VAR and goal-line technology, and has grown in popularity, with millions of fans worldwide.
